CALLING CONVENTION:
    When a function is called, arguments 0-6 are put in registers 1-7 respectively. All other
    argumenst are pushed onto the stack in reverse order. For example, if a function takes 10
    arguments, the virtual machine's memory will look like:
    Vm {
        ...
        registers: [ <reg0>, arg0, arg1, ..., arg6],
        memory: [..., arg9, arg8, arg7],
        ...
    }
    Register 0 is reserved as the accumulator register.
    Functions which require heap allocated objects should push the referring ObjectRef into the
    respective parameter.
    Function return values should be follow the same pattern as arguments.
    Functions which take `self`, an ObjectRef which refers to the "current" object, should pass
    `self` as the first argument.
