CALLING CONVENTION:
    When a function is called, arguments 1-8 are put in registers 0-7 respectively. All other
    argumenst are pushed onto the stack in reverse order. For example, if a function takes 10
    arguments, the virtual machine's memory will look like:
    Vm {
        ...
        registers: [arg0, arg1, ..., arg7],
        memory: [..., arg9, arg8],
        ...
    }
    Functions which require heap allocated objects should push the referring ObjectRef into the
    respective parameter.
    Function return values should be follow the same pattern as arguments.
    Functions which take `self`, an ObjectRef which refers to the "current" object, should pass
    `self` as the first argument.
